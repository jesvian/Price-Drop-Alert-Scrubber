# Price-Drop-Alert-Scrubber
This project was created to track and alert the user of a drop in a product's price on Amazon.com AND a price drop in a user's stock of choice.
The program checks the price of the product twice a day, and sends an email notifying the user if there is a drop in the price. 
For the stock, it checks the price every 5 minutes and sends and email to the user if there is a drop in price.
